# It library

## Java-Enterprise-project-Frontend

This is the frontend of an online it library simulation.
The frontend is React. Users can browse books, or filter them by category.
Every book has a detailed book page also. Users have their own user page as well.

The frontend communicates with the backend (a Java Spring application) through axios ajax requests.
The backend is on a different repository: <https://github.com/tothmate911/Java-Enterprise-project-Backend>.
